# webpack-sass-barebones

Basic working example of webpack / sass / autoprefixer thing.

1. Install node/npm if you don't already have it:

    ```
    $ brew install node
    ```
    
2. Install npm packages:
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
3. Run that shit
    1. To run dev server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with hot module reloading (the CSS is inserted into the page dynamically and can be viewed in the "Elements" tab of Chrome):
        ```
        $ npm run dev
        ```
    1. To build the CSS file as a standalone thing in `dist/main.css`:
        ```
        $ npm run build    
        ```

Buncha different stuff
